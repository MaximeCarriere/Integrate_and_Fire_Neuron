# Phase_Locking_3_neurons

- 3 fully connected neurons
- Graphic representation of:
    - Memrane potential
    - Spike 

Play with the value of weights to change from excitatory to inhibitory neurons

# Structured_neural_network

Code adapted from Trappenberg book ==> Izikevitch network


- 1000 fully connected neurons, 800 Excitatory and 200 Inhibitory
- Graphic representation of:
    - Raster plot

Observation of a structured raster plot with balance Excitation-Inhibition

Play with the number of Excitatory and Inhibitory Neurons to observe different structures
